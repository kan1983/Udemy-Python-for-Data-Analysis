    "Naive Bayes is probably one of the practical machine learning algorithms. Despite its name, it is actually performs very well considering its classification performance. It proves to be quite robust to irrelevant features, which it ignores. It learns and predicts very fast and it does not require lots of storage. So, why is it then called naive?\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive was added to the account for one assumption that is required for Bayes to work optimally: all features must be independent of each other. In reality, this is usually not the case, however, it still returns very good accuracy in practice even when the independent assumption does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously document classification and spam filtering. We will be working with the Iris Flower data set in this lecture."
